# Introduction

### Plot
Imagine we need a web application to display various data, where each bit of data has a latitude and longitude. We would like to display this on a Map, in a React application. We also want to save the Geo data in Mongo and User data in Postgres at the same time. The app will have a robust RESTful API written with the Koa framework in Node.js. We will also leverage Docker to deploy this application stack to any cloud provider.

This book will cover:

* React + Mapbox
    * Displaying Geo Data on a Mapbox map
* Node.js
    * Koa API Framework
    * Connect to Mongo
    * Connect to Postgres
    * Authentication
    * Testing
